UML Domian Design possible flaws

-An address can belong to many students (Domain model shows one to one relationship)
-Bridgin entities are easier to us with identifiers (UML implements aggregation with classes as attributes instead of using identifiers which are easier to manage)
-All attributes have public access modifiers, to strengthen data integraty identifiers(keys) should be protected or private
-There is a missing multiplicity between NAME and STUDENT
-NAME nad ADDRESS should should incorporate identifies eg id primary keys amking it easier to link to other Entities.

Implementation of the system possible flaws.

-System does not contain API packages, this would take all the work from the controller and put it in api reducing the boiler     plant code in controller classes
-A better use of data structures for storring data in memory could increase runtime
-Our system is not independenly deployable because its only a section of the Problem statment
-Could use less value objects as it is harder to manage in a relational database
-Data type types shouold be more secure to protect data from being manipulate where it shouldnt be muttable.
