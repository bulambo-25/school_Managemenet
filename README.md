UML Domian Design possible flaws
- An address can belong to many student (Domain model shows one to one relationship)
- Bridgin entities are easier to us with identifiers (UML implements aggregation with classes as attributes instead of using identifiers which are easier to manage)
- All attributes are have public access modifiers, to strengthen data integraty identifiers(keys) should be protected or private 
- There is a missing multiplicity between NAME and STUDENT 
- NAME nad ADDRESS should should incorporate identifies eg id primary keys amking it easier to link to other Entities.
